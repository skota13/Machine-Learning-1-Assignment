    "The general principle of an ensemble method is to combine predictions of several base models in order to improve the prediction efficiency of the final model. Combine several model can be done either Sequentially or in Parallel. If the training of models is done in parallel it is called as BAGGING and if the same is done in Sequence it is called BOOSTING. BAGGING helps in reducing the Variance without impacting the Bias error, while BOOSTING helps in reducing the Bias error, without impacting the Variance error "
